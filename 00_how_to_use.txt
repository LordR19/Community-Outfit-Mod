# To change the color of a piece of clothing, you can use the "color_palettes" in "gfx\portraits\accessory_variations\textures\color_palettes".

# If you want to use a piece of clothing with a specific color, it is advisable to create a new "gene" in "common\genes".
# The gene references an "accessory" in "gfx\portraits\accessories".
# The accessory references an "entity" in a subfolder of "gfx\models\portraits\attachments".
# In the file with the "entity" a "variation" is referenced, that you can find in "gfx\portraits\accessory_variations".
# That variation references a ".dds" file in "gfx\portraits\accessory_variations\textures\color_palettes"

# I usually copy the relevant parts of vanilla files into the correct folders and change the ".dds" file when I already implemented the Gene.
# By doing that you can directly see how the changes in the texture change the clothes.
# Be sure to save the .dds file with the RGB8 Format and see the file in the folder for more informations.
